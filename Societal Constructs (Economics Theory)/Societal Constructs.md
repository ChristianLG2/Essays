*"The passion for acquisiꢀon, which is erroneously promoted and extolled in economic*

*systems, is only the passion for acquisiꢀon of ꢀme, power, and ease. This should not*

*be mistaken for great passion or for love of humanity.” (Nieztche)*

On Property and Inequality:

*“From this Equality of ability ariseth equality of hope in the aꢁaining of our end. And*

*therefore, if any two men desire the same thing, which nevertheless they cannot both*

*enjoy, they become enemies”. (Hobbes, p. 75)*

Said the Philosopher in his magnum opus, a revoluꢀonary masterpiece of its own ꢀme and of literature

history, the “Real” (In many spectrums and realms) Social Construct: “[The] Leviathan” where Thomas

Hobbes stated the very origins of an idealisꢀc state. In this quote Thomas Hobbes describes the equal

ability that all men possess in the aꢁaining of their individual goals regardless of some minor individual

diﬀerences, staꢀng that no single person has an overwhelming advantage over another to achieve their

ends. Hence, everyone has roughly equal hope or expectaꢀon to achieve their desires or goals.

It is understandable that for Thomas Hobbes this is the main reason for the need for a societal construct,

despite these diﬀerences, everyone is equally able to threaten others to obtain what is only enjoyable by

one and only one. Thus, puꢂng at risk what property as in this context is deﬁned and disrupꢀng “the

natural state” into a “state of war”.

Here as far as the author of this brief criꢀque essay is concerned, we have the root of the great dilemma

of our modern and post-modern ꢀmes, one that philosophers during the enlightenment faced:

“Inequality”. This is the main focus of the discourse in this essay, not the mere criꢀque of modern

philosophy to build social constructs in order to answer the quesꢀon on the right of property but to pass

unseen and let pass unheard how these societal constructs that provide protecꢀon on the individual

property do not provide the ability to possess or else gain possession in other words “Inequality of

means”.

For the purposes of this criꢀque (although the author personal tendencies towards Materialism as the

deﬁnite way to describe the causaꢀons and relaꢀons within socieꢀes) admits the intertwinement of the

Economic and Poliꢀcal concepts but focuses its criꢀque primarily on the ﬁrst to beꢁer understand the

second.

Having said thus, we may conꢀnue to the very substance of the essay: The author’s criꢀque.

The Individual: The End, The mean, or The Enemy?

*Where the means is taken for the end, only an insaꢀable and anxious spirit remains,*

*one that strives for one thing and is unsaꢀsꢂed with everything. So, the passion for*

*acquisiꢀon must be put in the service of a passion for something higher: a passion for*

*knowledge, for truth, or for human development." (Nieztche)*

On this maꢁer (whether the individual is the end, the mean, or the enemy) we will consider two

diﬀerent perspecꢀves about Ownership, Hobbes’, and John Locke’s:

Hobbes, in his poliꢀcal philosophy, emphasizes the need for a strong central authority to maintain order

and prevent the "war of all against all" in the state of nature. He argues that individuals willingly

surrender their natural rights to the sovereign in exchange for protecꢀon and social stability. In this

context, ownership is not seen as an inherent right, but rather a construct established by the sovereign

for the sake of maintaining order and prevenꢀng conﬂicts. Hobbes' perspecꢀve does not place the

individual as the end or the mean but instead emphasizes the need for a strong authority to regulate and

control individual behavior.

In contrast, John Locke's philosophy provides a diﬀerent perspecꢀve on ownership. Locke argues that

individuals have a natural right to acquire and possess property through their labor. According to him,

individuals own their own bodies and by extension, the labor they exert. By mixing their labor with

natural resources, individuals acquire righꢃul ownership of the transformed property. Locke's view

emphasizes the individual as the end, granꢀng individuals the right to acquire and possess property as a

means of securing their own interests and well-being.

Both perspecꢀves have implicaꢀons for the relaꢀonship between the individual and ownership:

While Hobbes' perspecꢀve emphasizes the role of authority and the relinquishing of natural rights for

the sake of social order. Ownership is a construct established by the sovereign to regulate and prevent

conﬂicts between individuals. And Locke's perspecꢀve sees ownership as a natural right derived from an

individual's labor. Ownership becomes a means for individuals to secure their own interests and well-

being. The irony of our post-modern era lies in the juxtaposiꢀon of both Poliꢀcal Systems here described.

*"The execuꢀve of the modern state is but a commiꢁee for managing the common*

*aﬀairs of the whole bourgeoisie." (Marx)*

The Author conꢀnues to explain: Liberalism, as espoused by thinkers like Locke, emphasizes individual

rights, limited government intervenꢀon, and free markets. It promotes the idea of individuals freely

pursuing their interests and owning property. However, in the context of capitalist fundamentalisms

imposed globally, there can be a departure from these principles. Locke's principles of individual rights

and property ownership can be undermined in a system where capitalist fundamentalisms prevail. As

capitalism expands globally, it can result in the concentraꢀon of wealth and power in the hands of a few,

creaꢀng economic inequaliꢀes and limiꢀng opportuniꢀes for individuals to exercise their rights and

acquire property. The global imposiꢀon of capitalist fundamentalisms can lead to the exploitaꢀon of

resources and labor, undermining the principles of individual freedom and autonomy that Locke

advocated.

This imposiꢀon of capitalist fundamentalisms globally, oꢄen driven by powerful economic and poliꢀcal

interests, can resemble Hobbes' descripꢀon of a strong central authority managing the aﬀairs of the

bourgeoisie. It can prioriꢀze the interests of a small elite and reinforce social hierarchies, potenꢀally

leading to the erosion of individual rights and freedoms.

So is the Individual the end, the mean, or the enemy? The author’s conclusion is that the individual is

not to be found at any of these on a “State of Nature” and only when Poliꢀcal systems come into play

and Material condiꢀons are set the individual forms part of the “Social Construct”. To be more concise,

the author’s pose is that the Individual is inexistent on himself, and therefore cannot be any of them

unꢀl society exists, thus giving birth to economics.

The Hegemony of an Economic system is the Hegemony of Ideals, in other Words “The

Ring to rule them all”. In Other Words: The Perpetuaꢀon of “The Last man”

*"Everywhere we remain unfree and chained to technology, whether we passionately*

*aﬃrm or deny it. But we are delivered over to it in the worst possible way when we*

*regard it as something neutral; for this concepꢀon of it, to which today we*

*parꢀcularly like to do homage, makes us uꢁerly blind to the essence of technology." -*

*- Marꢀn Heidegger, "The Quesꢀon Concerning Technology."*

It is crucial to understand that the Poliꢀcal systems exist based on Philosophy systems since the laꢁer is

not inﬂuenced by the ﬁrst, but independent from it. Such as the excellent Aleksandr Dugin points out:

*“Poliꢀcs without Philosophy is not possible at all.” (Dugin)*

What does this mean for us? As the author pointed at the beginning of his criꢀque there exist an

Intertwinement of both the Economical and Poliꢀcal systems; throughout this excerpt the author has

been able to represent the independency of Philosophy and the dependency of the other two. Based on

this the author proceeds to lay the foundaꢀons of the conclusion:

“Economical along with the poliꢀcal systems are deﬁned by the principles exposed by philosophy and

although this last one possesses the independency of the two ﬁrst is easy for, he that possesses the

means and abiliꢀes to self-beneﬁt from it and mask the true morals of any given social construct.”

In other words, the author’s criꢀque to the economical systems is not in opposiꢀon to the natural desire

of development propelled by technology, but instead the usage of technologies to possess and capitalize

the right to Ideologize, thus, to later impose these reasonings on other social environments destroying

the mulꢀpolarity of the construct as whole hence Hegemony of ideas, Hegemony of capital, Hegemony

of Poliꢀcs. In deﬁniꢀon “A ring to rule them all”

Under such a hegemonic system, individuals are pressured or condiꢀoned to conform to the prevailing

norms and values. The aspiraꢀon to quesꢀon, challenge, or transcend the status quo might be

suppressed. As a result, people might be pushed towards a state of complacency and mediocrity,

focused only on immediate graꢀﬁcaꢀon and personal comfort, embodying the characterisꢀcs of

Nietzsche’s “The Last Man".

Thinkers of the world, Unite!

As Marx called for a revoluꢀon of the classes, The author implores for a revoluꢀon of ideals. Just as Marx

saw the need to upheave a system that entrenched class dispariꢀes, The author observes a pressing

need to dismantle the structures perpetuaꢀng a monolithic ideology that breeds inequality and

complacency, the characterisꢀcs of the "Last Man".

By encouraging a revoluꢀon of ideals, the author does not advocate for chaos or anarchy, but for a

renaissance of thought. A recogniꢀon that we are not bound by the constructs imposed upon us, but

that we have the power to deﬁne our own ideals and values. To create systems that foster real equality,

that value diversity, and that allow every individual to thrive.

In our postmodern era, faced with myriad complexiꢀes and challenges, let us not succumb to the easy

path of complacency and unquesꢀoning acceptance. Let us rise, thinkers of the world, challenge the

status quo, shaꢁer the hegemony of a singular ideology, and redeﬁne our socieꢀes in ways that truly

promote freedom and prosperity for all.

Thinkers of the world, it is ꢀme to unite. Not against a common enemy, but for a common purpose: to

challenge, to rethink, and to revoluꢀonize. The revoluꢀon of ideals begins with us. This is the true

Economical Revoluꢀon.
